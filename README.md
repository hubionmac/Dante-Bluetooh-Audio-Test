# Dante-Bluetooh-Audio-Test

I have bought a [Audinate AVIO Bluetooth Adapter](https://www.audinate.com/products/devices/dante-avio#BT) to attach my iPad with via Bluetooth instead of a cable.... 
I hoped when using Spotify the m4a audio-stream whould be bassed through so I would not encounter any quality loose while using music from spotify or any other m4a source, but no.

So just to give everyone an idea between normal audio-playback (just direct recording via Screenflow Computer Audio recording) and a recording via Dante Virtual-Soundcard from that captures audio from the Dante-Bluetooth Adapter.

- 1st 30sec are the orig. Audio

- 2nd 30sec are the captured bluetooth audio

Audio-Levels of the bluetooth recording are a bit alterered due to the adapters low output-level (audio was @100% on the iPhone during playback)


Orig. Wav file played back is from [here](https://file-examples-com.github.io/uploads/2017/11/file_example_WAV_5MG.wav)
